<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
This document describes the RMI-IIOP End-To-End Test Assertions Test Suite 
that will be developed by JavaSoft QA for end to end testing of the RMI-IIOP
Standard Extension that will be part of Sun's (J2EE) Reference Implementation. 
The RMI-IIOP End-To-End Test Assertions are based upon the latest RMI-IIOP
related specifications from the Object Management Group (OMG).

<P><P><PRE><U>Description</U> : 
All of the standard Java primitive types are supported as part of RMI/IDL
for RMI-IIOP. These are: void, boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, 
double. All of these Java primitives can be transmitted across an RMI/IDL
remote interface at run time. 

Test passing Java primitives as arguments.

Test returning Java primitives as return values.

Arrays of any conforming RMI/IDL are also conforming RMI/IDL types. Arrays
of Java primitives can be transmitted across and RMI/IDL remote interface
at run time.

<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Test</FONT></B> : 3</PRE> 
<PRE><I>Section</I> : 1.2.4 (Java-To-IDL Mapping Spec)</PRE>
<P><P><PRE><U>Description</U> : 
Passing of objects by value is allowed in RMI-IIOP. An RMI/IDL value type 
represents a class whose values can be moved between systems. So rather 
than transmitting a reference between systems, the actual state of the 
object is transmitted between systems. This requires that the receiving 
system have an analogous class that can be used to hold the received value.
A Java class is a conforming RMI/IDL value type if:

(1) The class must directly or indirectly implement the java.io.Serializable
    interface.

(2) The class may implement the java.io.Externalizable.

(3) The class and its superclasses are public.

(4) If the class is an inner class, then its containg class must also be
    a conforming RMI/IDL value type.

(5) A value type must not either directly or indirectly implement the
    java.rmi.Remote interface.

(6) A value type may implement any public interface except for java.rmi.Remote.

(7) There are no restrictions on method signatures for a value type.

(8) There are no restrictions on static fields for a value type.

(9) There are no restrictions on transient fields for a value type.

Test passing objects by value as arguments.

Test returning objects by value as return values.

<PRE><I>Section</I> : 1.2.3 (Java-To-IDL Mapping Spec)</PRE>
<P><P><PRE><U>Description</U> : 
An RMI remote interface defines a Java interface that can be invoked remotely.
A Java interface is a conforming RMI/IDL remote interface if:

(1) The interface inherits from java.rmi.Remote either directly or indirectly.

(2) The interface and interfaces that it extends (either directly or indirectly)
    are public.

(3) All methods in the interface must throw java.rmi.RemoteException.

(4) Method arguments and result types can be of any types.

(5) All specified method exceptions other than java.rmi.RemoteException are
    conforming RMI/IDL exception types.

(6) Method names may be overloaded. However, when an interface directly
    inherits from several base interfaces, it is forbidden for there to
    be method name conflicts between inherited interfaces.

(7) Constant definitions in the form of interface variables are permitted.

When passing a remote interface as an argument in a method call or returing 
a remote interface as a return value of a method call the remote interface
is passed and returned by reference. The class of the actual object that is
passed or returned must be either the stub class or the tie class of the
remote interface.

Test passing a remote interface as an argument and verify on the server side
that you can call one of its methods.

Test returning a remote interface as a return value and verify on the client
side that you can call one of its methods.

<PRE><I>Section</I> : 1.2.6 (Java-To-IDL Mapping Spec)</PRE>
<P><P><PRE><U>Description</U> : 
An RMI/IDL exception type inherits from java.lang.Exception. A user should
be able to throw any exception that inherits from java.lang.Exception in 
RMI-IIOP. A user defined exception will be defined in a remote interface
and the throwing of this user defined exception will be tested under 
RMI-IIOP. System and runtime exceptions are also RMI/IDL exception types. 
Throw a RemoteException, an EJBException, a NullPointerException, and an 
Error. In all 4 cases the container should catch the exception, log it, and 
then throw a RemoteException back to the client. A conforming RMI/IDL 
exception class must have the following:

(1) The class must directly or indirectly inherit java.lang.Exception.

(2) The class must meet the requirements of the RMI/IDL value types.

Test throwing a user defined exception.
Test throwing system and runtime exceptions. The container should catch 
the exception, log it, and then throw a RemoteException back to client.

Passing a graph of Java objects by value is allowed in RMI-IIOP. An RMI/IDL 
value type represents a class whose values can be moved between systems. So 
rather than transmitting a reference between systems, the actual state of the 
object is transmitted between systems. This requires that the receiving 
system have an analogous class that can be used to hold the received value.
When passing or returning a graph of Java objects by value all of the Java 
objects in the graph are traversed and transmitted across an RMI/IDL remote
interface at run time.

graph of objects is correct.

the graph of objects is correct.
